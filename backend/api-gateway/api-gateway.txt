1. API Gateway Service (Port: 8000)
Purpose: Acts as the single entry point and traffic controller for the entire NYC Transit Hub application, managing all incoming client requests and routing them to appropriate backend services.
Core Responsibilities:

Request Routing: Intelligently forwards requests to the correct microservice based on URL paths and HTTP methods
Authentication Management: Verifies Firebase ID tokens from client requests before allowing access to protected resources
Rate Limiting: Prevents API abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP address within a time window
CORS Management: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow frontend applications to communicate securely
Request/Response Logging: Tracks all API calls for monitoring, debugging, and analytics purposes
Error Handling: Provides consistent error responses across all services
Load Distribution: Can distribute traffic across multiple instances of backend services

Key Features:

Health check endpoint for monitoring service availability
Request validation and sanitization
Response caching for frequently accessed public data
API versioning support
Middleware pipeline for extensibility

Technology Stack:

Flask for lightweight API handling
Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
Flask-Limiter for rate limiting
Redis (optional) for distributed rate limiting and caching

No Database Required - Stateless service that relies on other services for data

API Endpoints Managed:
/api/transit/*        → Transit Service
/api/favorites/*      → Favorites Service
/api/alerts/*         → Alerts Service
/api/accessibility/*  → Accessibility Service
/health              → Gateway health check

Use Cases:

Mobile app makes a request to get subway status → Gateway verifies auth and routes to Transit Service
Web app saves a favorite station → Gateway validates Firebase token and forwards to Favorites Service
Admin dashboard checks system health → Gateway provides status of all services
