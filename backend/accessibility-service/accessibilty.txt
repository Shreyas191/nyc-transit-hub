5. Accessibility Service (Port: 8005)
Purpose: Dedicated service for providing comprehensive accessibility information to ensure the transit system is navigable for users with disabilities, particularly those requiring elevators or escalators.
Core Responsibilities:

Equipment Status Tracking: Monitors real-time status of all elevators and escalators across the system
ADA Compliance Data: Provides information about which stations meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards
Outage Management: Tracks equipment outages with start/end times and estimated repairs
Accessible Route Planning: Helps users plan trips using only accessible stations
Equipment Locations: Detailed location descriptions for finding equipment within stations
Status History: Maintains historical data for reliability analysis
Alternative Options: Suggests nearby accessible stations when equipment is out of service

Key Features:

Real-time equipment status updates from MTA feeds
Filter stations by full accessibility (elevator + platform)
Equipment reliability scoring based on historical outages
Notifications integration for equipment status changes
Multi-language support for accessibility information
Equipment maintenance schedules
Crowdsourced status verification (future enhancement)

Technology Stack:

Flask with SQLAlchemy
MTA Equipment API integration
SQLite for persistent storage
Scheduled updates every 10 minutes

Database: SQLite (accessibility.db)

elevators - All elevators in the system
escalators - All escalators in the system
station_accessibility - Overall accessibility ratings per station

Schema Details:
sqlelevators:
  - id (MTA equipment ID)
  - station_id (links to station)
  - status ('active', 'outage', 'maintenance')
  - location_description (e.g., "Street to Mezzanine")
  - ada_compliance (boolean)
  - outage_start, outage_end (nullable timestamps)
  - updated_at

escalators:
  - Similar structure to elevators
  - direction ('up', 'down', 'bidirectional')
  
station_accessibility:
  - station_id, ada_compliant (boolean)
  - has_elevator, elevator_count
  - has_escalator, escalator_count
  - accessibility_notes (TEXT)
  - last_verified (timestamp)
API Endpoints:
GET /api/accessibility/stations              - All accessible stations
GET /api/accessibility/stations/{id}         - Station accessibility details
GET /api/accessibility/elevators             - All elevators with status
GET /api/accessibility/elevators/{id}        - Specific elevator info
GET /api/accessibility/elevators/outages     - Current outages
GET /api/accessibility/escalators            - All escalators with status
GET /api/accessibility/route                 - Plan accessible route between stations
GET /api/accessibility/alternatives/{id}     - Find nearby accessible stations
Background Jobs:

sync_equipment_status - Fetches latest status from MTA every 10 minutes
calculate_reliability_scores - Daily calculation of equipment uptime percentages

No Authentication Required - Public accessibility information should be freely available
Use Cases:

User in wheelchair needs to commute → Service shows only stations with working elevators
Elevator goes out of service → Service updates status immediately for route planning
User planning trip → Service provides accessible route avoiding stations with outages
Transit authority → Uses outage data to prioritize maintenance
Developer building accessibility app → Uses API to power their application
