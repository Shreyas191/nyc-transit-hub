Service Communication
Synchronous (REST APIs)

Frontend ↔ API Gateway (with Firebase token)
API Gateway ↔ Individual Services

Authentication Flow

User authenticates with Firebase on frontend
Frontend gets Firebase ID token
Frontend sends token in Authorization header to API Gateway
API Gateway verifies token with Firebase Admin SDK
API Gateway extracts user UID and forwards to services
Services use UID to associate data with users
